# Datset
The Hepatitis dataset is a dataset that contains information related to the diagnosis of hepatitis, a viral infection that affects the liver. It is commonly used in machine learning and data analysis tasks to study and predict the diagnosis of hepatitis based on various medical features.

Here is a brief overview of the Hepatitis dataset:

### Number of Instances:
The dataset consists of 155 instances or samples.

### Number of Features: 
There are 20 features or attributes in the dataset, which include both numerical and categorical variables.

### Target Variable:

The target variable in the dataset is typically a binary classification representing whether a patient has hepatitis or not. The specific column name for the target variable may vary depending on the dataset source.

### Features: 
The features in the dataset provide information about various aspects related to the patient's medical condition, such as age, sex, symptoms, laboratory test results, and medical history. These features can include factors like the patient's age, sex, fatigue, nausea, abdominal pain, presence of ascites or edema, bilirubin levels, albumin levels, prothrombin time, and more.

### Missing Values: 
The dataset may contain missing values that need to be handled appropriately before performing any analysis or modeling.

### Dataset Source: 
The Hepatitis dataset is commonly used in the machine learning community and can be found in various repositories and datasets collections. The specific source of the dataset may vary, so it's important to refer to the dataset documentation or the source from where you obtained it.
